= Overview =
Duplicator is the most powerful migrator available. It enables you to:

* Move, migrate or clone a WordPress site between domains or hosts with **zero downtime**
* Pull down a live site to localhost for development
* Transfer a WordPress site from one host to another
* Manually backup a WordPress site or parts of a site
* Duplicate a live site to a staging area or vice versa
* Bundle up an entire WordPress site for easy reuse or distribution
* Perform a full WordPress migration without struggling with messy import/export sql scripts

= Migrate WordPress and Run WordPress Backups =
Duplicator creates a package that bundles all the site's plugins, themes, content, database and WordPress files into a simple zip file called a package. This package can then be used to easily migrate a WordPress site to any location you wish.  Move on the same server, across servers and pretty much any location a WordPress site can be hosted.  *WordPress is not required for installation* since the package contains all site files.

= Improve Your Workflow with Pre-Bundled Sites =
Duplicator lets you make your own preconfigured sites to eliminate rework.  Instead of manually configuring your favorite theme, set of plugins or content over and over, now just configure a single site and bundle it up into a Duplicator package. Once you have the bundled site, you can migrate the WordPress site over and over to different locations to instantly create many preconfigured sites!
